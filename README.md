# DataEngineering 
Using Azure Synapse Analytics I have used copy pipeline from HTTP open source to SQL DB and performed some transforamtions in Notebook using Spark.
Wrote SQL code to join tables and get some insights into the data.
By the end of this small project I can show that I have skills in using Azure Synapse, where I can easily use (Pipeline+notebook+DataBase(Serverless&Dedicated)) and get insights from the data where I can connected to PowerBI and perform further transformations.
